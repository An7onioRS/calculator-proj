A Calculator Program with simple user interface that can perform different mathematical operations.


 1. To create the calculator, I need to create a grid-looking structure with buttons and a display. 
 
 2. The first row has to be the display and the other ones will contain 4 buttons each. 
 
 3. When a digit is clicked, I need to store the variable of the digit in a variable. Then, when an operation is clicked, I need to store that too. Then, when a second digit is clicked, I need to store that too. THen, if when the equals button is clicked -> I need to put them to the function operate and get the result and display it on the display row of the calculator. Else if the clear button is clicked, I need to clear the variables and start again. But what should the display row look like? -->
